Frank's League Account Manager:
- Run the program using the .exe file in the 'dist' folder
- Set file path to path of LeagueClient.exe
- Account info and path info are stored in the 'Files' folder
- Reference Images are stored in the 'ReferenceImages' folder

Features:
- GUI to add accounts, delete them, and change League Client's filepath to the correct one
- Launches game and auto-inputs login information
- Infinitely scales with mulitple accounts

Roadmap:
- Prebuilt Binaries
	- Read how to add the stuff I needed "ahk folder" and "reference images" into the compiled .exe with launch options
	- Or maybe modify the .spec file?
	- Use NSIS?
	- Make a download link in github page
